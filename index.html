<p>I'll assume you aren't here to figure out how to get or build the code. You want to use this thing, so I will help you. Start by ensuring you have the latest <a href="https://github.com/kainazzzo/flatredball-spriter/releases">release</a></p>
<p>You will also need to download <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brashmonkey.com/">Spriter</a>, which is a tool developed by the fine folks at BrashMonkey.</p>
<p>I highly recommend going through the tutorials on their Youtube channel too:</p>

<p>You don't have to have a phenomenal understanding of Spriter to be able to use this plugin. The UI is fairly discoverable, so it's ok if you want to jump right in to my tutorials!</p>
